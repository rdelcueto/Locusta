Locusta 0.1.0
A Massively Parallel Evolutionary Computation Metaheuristic Framework.

Locusta provides a framework to build various population based evolutionary metaheuristics.

The current implementation uses CUDA to describe massively parallel kernels, to
compute: the evaluation of the fitness function on a population of genomes, the
methaheuristic processes (ej. mutation, crossover) and the generation of
pseudorandom numbers.

The collection of metaheuristics also has a CPU parallel implementation, written
using OpenMP. Implementations are not design to perform invariant
transformation, between architectures. Given that each platform, implies a
different problem to solve in the data-oriented design, each implementation can
vary widely in implementation. The framework provides a way to compare and measure
the performance throughoutput of each implementation, taking into account the
strenghts of each targeted architecture.

Current metaheuristics implementations:

  * Particle Swarm Optimization (Working prototype)
  * Genetic Algorithm (Working prototype)
  * Differential Evolution (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
